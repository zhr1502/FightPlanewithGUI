**FightPlane hasn't been finished so far. you can only experience some functions.**

# FightPlanewithGUI
An GUI application that enables you to play Planefight.
FightPlane is an in-paper game originally. ** [Here](https://github.com/Zjl37/planeFight2/wiki/Game-Introduction) is the introductions and gamerules of the game.**
### Purpose
---
This project is inspired by [planeFight2](https://github.com/Zjl37/planeFight2). However [planeFight2](https://github.com/Zjl37/planeFight2) runs with console, making it unconfortable to play.
FightPlanewithGUI is devoted to achieve the same function with GUI.
### How it works?
---
FightPlanewithGUI uses [EGE](https://github.com/wysaid/xege).
It relies on conio.h and Winsock.h to achieve keyboard interactions and multiplayer mod.
